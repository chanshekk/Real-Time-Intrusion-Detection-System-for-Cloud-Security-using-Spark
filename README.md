# Real-Time-Intrusion-Detection-System-for-Cloud-Security-using-Spark
This project implements a Real-Time Intrusion Detection System (IDS) using the UNSW-NB15 dataset and Apache Spark. It compares Spark and non-Spark approaches, with and without feature selection, using Decision Tree classifiers. Results include accuracy, F1-score, confusion matrix, and execution time analysis.
